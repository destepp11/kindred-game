# Welcome to the kindred-game repository!

## Purpose
This repository has the source code for a Unity project I have under development.

## Rules of the Repository
* Master branch is production, period.
* Do not commit to master, please work off the development branch.
* When working locally, try to work in feature branches.
* Please follow GitFlow.
* You may fork this repository freely, for personal or commerical use. It would be cool if you dropped my name in some credits, but it's not required.
